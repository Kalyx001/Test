                    How it Works
                </h2>
                <h3>
            
                For example if you  invest with $1,000 the company is going to be  trading on your behalf using an Auto  electronic mining manchine.
                
                this manchine is  %100 guarantee for locking all incoming profit, it also keep the trade signalðŸš¥ stable to prevent any negative effect from   MARKET-CAP.
                
                After the trade is completed  the company make Ã—14 of the money you   invested,  x10 of this  profit shall be sent to your  account immediately while the  company we get the remaining profit
                Which means you will get  {$10,000} while the company get the remaining {$4,000}
                </h3>

                <h3>
                    ITC started trading in year 2019 during the Covid pandemic. We bought a crypto electronic mining machine which can make money anytime. We have traded over <span>$450M</span> for our investors
                     
                </h3>
                <h3><span>BE YOUR OWN BOSS NOW BECAUSE </span></br>
(1.) Your salary will never make you rich. Your boss is not that foolish.</br>
(2) Your salary is fixed, are your expenses fixed?.</br>
(3.) If your company pays you the exact true value of the services you render, they would be running at a loss. As an employee, you are underpaid.</br>
(4.) Once you get HIRED, you either get FIRED or RETIRED, you may also resign when you're TIRED.</br>
(5.) Salary is the bribe you're given to forget your dreams, family, freedom, self-esteem, academics, social life and other personal goals.</br>
(6.) Your kids won't inherit your post in that company you're employed in. Employment is not hereditary.</br>
(7.) If your salary is not huge enough to pay your bills, leaving you with sufficient amount to save, prepare for poverty after you stop work</br>.
(8.) If you must work, before you eat, then if you get paralyzed, ill or become aged, hunger will strike you.</br>
 (9.) Being an employee is a bit similar to being a slave, you take orders, you are regimented
